To add walls back, you just need to uncomment several things. First you need to call fucntion createWalls() in the setup phase (jsut uncooment the call). Also uncomment detect_wall_tanks_collision in the play() method in order to detect the tanks-walls collsiion. To enable the collision between walls and bullets in the play method uncomment the last else statement in the filtering bullet method. Finally uncomment creating and sestroing walls in the reset method.
